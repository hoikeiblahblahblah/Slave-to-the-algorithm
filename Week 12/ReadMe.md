It has come to the final week of the semester and I am so glad to see everyone’s [hardwork](https://karenanndonnachie.github.io/Slave-To-The-Algorithm/Slave_ribbon/). Coming to the end of my project, I decided to set up an installation at home and see how it goes. I did it near sunset time which provides a slightly darker environment for clearer projection, I was afraid that graphics might look blurry but it looks quite clear when I projected it on the wall. <br/>

However, I found that the colour and vibe of the installation somehow reminds me of [disco light](https://www.amazon.com.au/Karaoke-Machine-Portable-Activated-Festival/dp/B01JO7AEK0/ref=sr_1_17?dchild=1&keywords=disco+light&qid=1603286523&sr=8-17) lmao. Maybe that’s where I get my inspiration from hahaha. <br/>
