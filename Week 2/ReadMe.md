We had our first coding workshop this week and I was very excited to learn and experiment new skills in a field that I have not tried before. It was definitely a good experience for me and I have a better understanding of how processing works.

We started the experiment with just a simple line of code by setting up a canvas and 2D primitives  , and after we got familiar with the functions, I created my first Processing design with the following simple codes. 
```javascript
void setup(){
size (500,500); //this is the size of the canvas
background (0); //this chooses our background colour
}

void draw(){//portrait
ellipse (250,250,160,220);
fill (0);
ellipse (220,220,30,40);
fill(0);
ellipse (280,220,30,40);
fill(255);
ellipse (220,220,10,10);//eyeball
fill(255);
ellipse (280,220,10,10);//eyeball
fill(255,204,204);
ellipse (250,300,60,30);//mouth
fill(255,255,255);
ellipse (170,265,30,40);//ear
fill(255,255,255);
ellipse (330,265,30,40);//ear
   
stroke(255); //this choose black as the outline
line (mouseX, mouseY, 250, 250); 
fill (255,255,255);
noStroke(); //turns stroke off
}

void keyPressed(){
background (mouseY/2, (mouseY+mouseX)/4,250-mouseX/2);
}
```

**Remix**<br/>
I remixed Connorâ€™s portrait. I used mouseX and mouseY function to make the design interactive, and added mousePressed function. So user can draw the hair of the character and erase it when they are not satisfy with the hairstyle. 
```javascript
void setup(){
background(247,198,59);
size (500, 500);
}

void draw(){
if (mousePressed){
fill (247,198,59);
noStroke();
ellipse (mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30);
}
else {
fill(0);
noStroke();
ellipse (mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30);
}

fill(230,200,180);
//the face follows from here
translate(250,250); 
//face
ellipse (0, 0, 150,200); 

//mouth
fill(mouseX/2, mouseY/2, (mouseX + mouseY)/4);
ellipse (0, 40, 70,30); 
noStroke();

//eyes
fill(255);
ellipse (30, -40, 40,40);
ellipse (-30, -40, 40,40);

fill (0);
ellipse (0-mouseX/20, -40, 15,15);
ellipse (mouseX/20, -40, 15,15);
}
```
