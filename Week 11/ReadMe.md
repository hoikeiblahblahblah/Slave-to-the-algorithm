Over the week, I have found a interesting processing library created by Thomas Diewald -- pixelFlow. It is a library for high performance GPU-computing(GLSL), gives developers more direct control of graphics without having to use hardware specific languages. One of its example â€”bloomDebug showcased a glowing effect on shapes. I think the graphic output might look good if apply this effect on my particle system.
