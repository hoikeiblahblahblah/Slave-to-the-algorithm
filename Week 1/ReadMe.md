# WK 1 thoughts and observations

For this week, we had an introduction of generative art and some interesting generative art works from different artists. I was very worried to do something in the field I have barely learn before, however all the art works are very interesting and it actually sparked my interest again. One of the artists mentioned in class was Rosa Menkmenâ€™s glitch generative art. Its movement between an artefact, a process and cool glitch gives a very unique aesthetic. <br/>

After which, we had an analogue design game with our group. We get to decide the parameters and throw dice randomly to create a random design. The results were very different even the whole group used the same parameters. The game helped me to get a deeper understanding of what generative design is.

[Mei Konishi](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCxT384HizV/?igshid=nms9mg4crkxk) is a freelance CG artist based in Tokyo, Japan. Her generative artworks involve a bunch of technique and softwares, such as Cinema 4D to modelling and programming skills to create a complicated artwork. She created textures for certain objects and combined it with processing to generate artworks that moves with music beats.
