# WK 1 thoughts and observations

For this week, we had an introduction of generative art and some interesting generative art works from different artists. I was very worried to do something in the field I have barely learn before, however all the art works are very interesting and it actually sparked my interest again. One of the artists mentioned in class was Rosa Menkmen’s glitch generative art. Its movement between an artefact, a process and cool glitch gives a very unique aesthetic. 

After which, we had an analogue design game with our group. We get to decide the parameters and throw dice randomly to create a random design. The results were very different even the whole group used the same parameters. The game helped me to get a deeper understanding of what generative design is.
