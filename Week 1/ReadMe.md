# WK 1 thoughts and observations

For this week, we had an introduction of generative art and some interesting generative art works from different artists. I was very worried to do something in the field I have barely learn before, however all the art works are very interesting and it actually sparked my interest again. One of the artists mentioned in class was Rosa Menkmenâ€™s glitch generative art. Its movement between an artefact, a process and cool glitch gives a very unique aesthetic.
