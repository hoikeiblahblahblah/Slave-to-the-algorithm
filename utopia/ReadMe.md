Utopia is an interactive installation of particles visualisation of human and object motions, creates a warm and abstract feelings about post-lockdown world. The installation is made with Processing which engage with users via Kinect sensor in real time. The generative graphic will then created and be projected on the wall. As the COVID-19 pandemic continue to unfold in our community, people might experience a wide range of thoughts and feeling disconnected from others, especially those who live alone. Under the circumstances that chances of going outdoor are limited, I wanted to do something that balance the relationship between normal social life and isolation, and also enhance isolation experience when weâ€™re alone.
